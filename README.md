# projectAICOM

SwiftUI tab-based concept for an AI assisted social app inspired by the shared design references.

## Getting Started

1. Open `projectAICOM.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer.
2. Select the **projectAICOM** scheme and an iPhone simulator (iOS 16 or newer).
3. Run the app (`Cmd+R`) to explore the connections feed and AI chat concept screens.

The entry screen lists highlighted collaborators. Use the floating action bar to switch to the AI assistant view or placeholder tab.
